# Bio-PathPAN-Example
Pathogen Informatics DarkPAN test case

Testing Pinto to manage a local DarkPAN. This is an example of how to use 'dzil release' to create a release, release it to the gihub project and inject directly into the Pathogen Informatics DarkPAN (pathPAN)

To understand how this is done, have a look at the .gitignore and the dist.ini files.
